      "Traveling internationally for the first time can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re juggling work, family and visa requirements at the same time. A clear checklist helps everything feel calmer.",
      "Start by confirming that your passport has at least six months’ validity from your intended return date. Many destinations will not board you if your passport is too close to expiry, even if your visa is valid.",
      "Next, clarify your visa requirements early. Some destinations offer visa-on-arrival or e-visa options, while others require embassy visits and supporting documents such as HR letters, bank statements and travel insurance.",
      "Once your visa plan is clear, lock in your flights and accommodation. For first-time travellers, we typically recommend routing with reliable airlines and staying in areas that are central, safe and easy to navigate.",
      "Finally, plan your airport timing: aim to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, and keep all your documents — passport, visa, ticket, insurance and hotel confirmation — in one simple folder."
